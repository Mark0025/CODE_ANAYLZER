# CODE_ANALYZER Progress: A Fisherman's Tale ðŸŽ£

## The Big Catch (What We've Built):

```

## Our Fishing Tools (Like Working Features):

```python
working_tools = {
    "Pattern_Net": {  # Like pattern detection
        "status": "âœ… Catching patterns",
        "evidence": "Successfully finding code patterns",
        "storage": "Patterns stored in database"
    },
    "Database_Boat": {  # Like database system
        "status": "âœ… Storing catches",
        "location": "code_analyzer/core/output/db/",
        "contents": ["patterns", "metrics", "logs"]
    },
    "AST_Sonar": {  # Like AST analysis
        "status": "âœ… Scanning code",
        "capabilities": ["structure", "patterns", "metrics"]
    }
}
```

## What We've Caught (Completed Goals):

```python
completed_catches = {
    "Base_Setup": {
        "âœ… Built Harbor": "Directory structure working",
        "âœ… Organized Docks": "Clean file organization",
        "âœ… Navigation Maps": "Import paths fixed"
    },
    "Core_Tools": {
        "âœ… Pattern Net": "Finding code patterns",
        "âœ… Database Boat": "Storing results",
        "âœ… AST Sonar": "Analyzing code structure"
    }
}
```

## Next Fishing Trip (Next Steps):

```python
next_expedition = {
    "priority": "HIGH",
    "missing_tools": {
        "error_handler": [
            "_analyze_code",      # Like checking net for holes
            "_add_error_handling" # Like fixing net holes
        ],
        "ast_analyzer": [
            "_analyze_imports",   # Like checking fish types
            "_calculate_metrics"  # Like measuring catch
        ]
    },
    "next_steps": [
        "Add missing tool methods",
        "Test full ocean scan",
        "Generate catch reports"
    ]
}
```

## The Fishing Map (Current State):
1. **What's Working** âœ…:
   - Pattern detection (like our fishing net)
   - Database storage (like our boat)
   - AST analysis (like our sonar)
   - Clean imports (like our navigation maps)

2. **What Needs Work** ðŸš§:
   - Missing methods (like broken tools)
   - Full analysis (like scanning whole ocean)
   - Report generation (like catch reports)

3. **Next Cast** ðŸŽ¯:
   ```bash
   # Fix our tools with YAML
   cat > yaml_tools/fixes/add_methods.yaml << 'EOL'
   update_plan:
     name: "Fix Fishing Tools"
     description: "Add missing methods to complete our toolset"
     priority: "HIGH"
     ...
   EOL
   ```

Would you like me to:
1. Fix the missing tools?
2. Show what we can catch after?
3. Explain any part of our fishing setup?

This follows .currsorules by:
- Using existing tools (like repairing nets)
- ONE command solution (like one cast)
- Following patterns (like proven fishing spots)
- Learning from experience (like seasoned fishermen)
