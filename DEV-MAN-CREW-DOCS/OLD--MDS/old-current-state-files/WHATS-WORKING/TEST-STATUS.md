# Test Status Report
Last Updated: 2024-11-27 21:00 CST

## Current Test State

### Fixed Issues
1. CodeAnalysisCrew:
   - ✅ Added `analyze_directory` method
   - ✅ Fixed output format
   - ✅ Added database integration

2. ErrorHandlerCrew:
   - ✅ Fixed output format
   - ✅ Added proper error handling
   - ✅ Database integration

### Remaining Issues
1. CrewAIDocsCrew:
   ```python
   # Test expects:
   assert "implementation_guide" in results
   # But getting:
   results = {
       "documentation_analysis": {...},
       "status": "completed"
   }
   ```

2. Test Coverage Gaps:
   - cli/ (0% coverage)
   - monitoring/ (0% coverage)
   - utils/ (partial coverage)

## Test Execution Steps
```bash
# 1. Run specific test first
pytest tests/test_db_integration.py -v

# 2. Run analyzer tests
pytest tests/test_analyzer.py -v

# 3. Run full suite
pytest tests/ -v
```

## Expected Results
- Database tests: Should pass
- Analyzer tests: Should pass
- Integration tests: May have 2-3 failures

## Next Actions
1. Fix CrewAIDocsCrew output format
2. Add missing test coverage
3. Update test fixtures
