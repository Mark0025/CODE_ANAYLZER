Last Updated: 11/27/24 3:15 PM CST

## Phase 1: Initial Analysis (GPT-3.5)
### Status: üöß In Progress

1. **Fix Current Issues**:
   - ‚úÖ API Key handling
   - ‚úÖ Rate limiter
   - üöß Timestamp standardization
   - üöß Async OpenAI calls

2. **Analysis Output Structure**:
```json
{
    "file_path": "path/to/file.py",
    "analysis_date": "MM/DD/YYYY",
    "status": "CRITICAL|WORKS|NEEDS-UPDATED|WORKING-FEATURE-RICH",
    "priority": 0-3,
    "findings": {
        "issues": [],
        "improvements": [],
        "rationale": "Detailed explanation"
    }
}
```

3. **GPT-3.5 Analysis Task**:
```python
analysis_task = Task(
    description="""Analyze this code with specific focus:
    1. Critical issues that affect functionality
    2. Working but improvable areas
    3. Feature enhancement opportunities
    
    Rate each finding as:
    - CRITICAL (Priority 0): Breaks functionality
    - WORKS (Priority 1): Functions but could improve
    - NEEDS-UPDATED (Priority 2): Should be enhanced
    - WORKING-FEATURE-RICH (Priority 3): Excellent state
    
    Provide detailed rationale for each finding.
    """,
    agent=analysis_agent
)
```

## Phase 2: Smart Analysis (GPT-4)
### Status: üìù Planned

1. **Consensus Building**:
   - Two agents debate improvements
   - Cost/benefit analysis
   - Impact assessment
   - Future-proofing evaluation

2. **Analysis Structure**:
```python
consensus_crew = Crew(
    agents=[
        improvement_agent,
        impact_agent
    ],
    tasks=[
        debate_task,
        consensus_task,
        implementation_task
    ]
)
```

3. **Output Format**:
```json
{
    "consensus": {
        "recommended_changes": [],
        "impact_analysis": {},
        "alternative_approaches": [],
        "final_recommendation": ""
    }
}
```

## Phase 3: PR Generation
### Status: üîú Upcoming

1. **PR Structure**:
   - Priority-based changes
   - Clear documentation
   - Impact statements
   - Rollback plans

2. **Implementation Order**:
   1. CRITICAL fixes first
   2. WORKS improvements
   3. NEEDS-UPDATED enhancements
   4. Feature additions

## Timeline
- Phase 1: This week
- Phase 2: Next week
- Phase 3: Following week

## Cost Analysis
- GPT-3.5 Analysis: ~$0.02/file
- GPT-4 Consensus: ~$0.10/decision
- Total Estimated: $5-10/full analysis

## Success Metrics
1. All CRITICAL issues resolved
2. 80%+ test coverage
3. Clear consensus on improvements
4. Working PR generation
