# Code Analyzer Development Plan ðŸš€

## Immediate Testing Plan for FINANCES Project

### 1. Setup Code Analyzer
```bash
# First, clone the Code Analyzer repository
cd /Users/markcarpenter/Desktop/projects/FINANCES
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/code_analyzer
cd code_analyzer

# Create and activate virtual environment
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # Since you're on Unix/Mac

# Install in development mode with all dependencies
uv pip install -e .
```
> Development mode (-e) lets you modify the code and test changes immediately
> without reinstalling.

### 2. Configure Environment
```bash
# Create .env file for OpenAI API key
echo "OPENAI_API_KEY=your-key-here" > .env
```
> The OpenAI key is required for AI-powered analysis

### 3. Run Initial Analysis
```bash
# Go back to FINANCES directory
cd ..

# Run analysis on entire project
code_analyzer .

# Or analyze specific directory
code_analyzer ./melbudget
```
> The tool will create a crews/crew-output directory with results

### 4. Check Results
```bash
# View analysis results
ls crews/crew-output/
cat crews/crew-output/analysis_results.json
```

## Understanding the Output

### 1. Analysis Results Structure
- `crews/crew-output/analysis_results.json`: Main analysis findings
- `crews/crew-output/cleanup_report.md`: Suggested improvements
- `crews/crew-output/logs/`: Detailed operation logs

### 2. Generated Reports
- Code structure analysis
- Dependency mapping
- Improvement suggestions
- Breaking change warnings

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### 1. Installation Problems
```bash
# If UV isn't installed
pip install uv

# If dependencies fail
uv pip install -e . --verbose
```

### 2. Permission Issues
```bash
# If crews directory creation fails
mkdir -p crews/crew-output
chmod 755 crews crews/crew-output
```

### 3. Path Issues
```bash
# If code_analyzer command not found
export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/.local/bin"
# or
python -m code_analyzer .
```

## Next Steps After Analysis

1. [ ] Review generated reports
2. [ ] Implement suggested changes
3. [ ] Run analysis again to verify improvements
4. [ ] Create PRs for approved changes

## Future Improvements

1. [ ] Add PyPI distribution for easier installation
2. [ ] Implement automatic PR generation
3. [ ] Add GitHub Actions integration
4. [ ] Create VS Code extension

Remember:
- Keep the virtual environment activated while testing
- Check crews/crew-output/ for all analysis results
- Use --verbose flag for detailed logging
- Back up important files before implementing changes

## Learning Points

1. **Virtual Environments**
   > Why we use them: Isolate project dependencies and avoid conflicts

2. **Development Installation**
   > Why -e flag: Allows code modification without reinstalling

3. **Directory Structure**
   > Why crews/crew-output: Organized output for better tracking

4. **Logging**
   > Why detailed logs: Essential for debugging and tracking analysis

## Success Metrics

- [ ] Successfully analyzes FINANCES project
- [ ] Generates actionable recommendations
- [ ] Creates clear, organized output
- [ ] Handles large codebases efficiently
