# .currsorules - Code Analyzer Decision Framework

## Decision Tree for Code Changes:

### 1. 🎯 Single File Quick Fixes
USE: YAML AND ANAYLZE CODE STRUCTURE AND IMPORTS ALWAYS LARGEST ISSUES FIRST - ANNALYZE SO YOU KNOW WITH 96% CONFIDIENCE YOUR FIX WILL BE A IMPROVMENT NOT CONFUSION
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Single File Change] -->|Quick Fix| B[Use Cursor]
    A -->|Small Refactor| B[Use Cursor]
    
    Examples[Examples:]
    * Variable renaming
    * Function signature updates
    * Single import fixes
```

### 2. 🏗️ Multi-File/Structural Changes
USE: **YAML Automation** YOU ARE A REPORTER NOT A FIXER -- YOU REPORT IN 
    .md and xml files you build yaml for Code Analyzer to run -
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Multi-File Change] -->|Generate YAML| B[Use CODE_ANALYZER]
    A -->|Run Command| C[Auto-Updates]
    
    Examples[Examples:]
    * Import fixes across files
    * Directory restructuring
    * Pattern implementation
```

### 3. 🔧 System Commands
USE: **Automation Scripts**  YOU ARE A REPORTER NOT A FIXER -- YOU REPORT IN 
    .md and xml files you build yaml for Code Analyzer to run -
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[System Tasks] -->|Run Script| B[Automated Process]
    A -->|No Manual Steps| C[Verified Results]
    
    Examples[Examples:]
    * Directory creation
    * Test running
    * Build processes
```

## Command Categories:
YOU ARE A REPORTER NOT A FIXER -- YOU REPORT IN 
    .md and xml files you build yaml for Code Analyzer to run -

    MAKE SURE FILE FOLDER AND STRUCTURE IS CORRECT IN ANAYLZE STAGE BEFORE BUILD STAGE OR YOU ARE CREATING PROBLEMS FOR YOU AND OTHERS -

### 1. YAML-Based Updates:
```bash
# For multi-file changes
python -m code_analyzer.crews.dev_crews.run_updates \
    --spec yaml_tools/TYPE/update-name.yaml \
    --verbose \
    --target ./
```

### 2. System Setup:
```bash
# For system-wide changes
python -m code_analyzer.cli.auto_setup \
    --type [setup|test|docs] \
    --verbose
```

### 3. Documentation:
```bash
# For documentation updates
python -m code_analyzer.crews.doc_crews.update \
    --target DEV-NOW/CURRENT\
    --type markdown -
    --verbose
    -- XML - LONG FORM - PLAN -FUTURE PLAUYING OUT HOW THIS IMPACTS THE CODEBASE AND CONFIDENCE SCORE THAT WHEN RAN WE WILL BE AT 96%
    --{FOLDER-NAME} - NESTED FOLDERS ONLY IF NEEDED _ 
```

## Never Manual:
❌ No direct file editing - YOU ARE A REPORTER NOT A FIXER -- YOU REPORT IN 
    .md and xml files you build yaml for Code Analyzer to run -
❌ No manual directory creation  YOU ARE A REPORTER NOT A FIXER -- YOU REPORT IN 
    .md and xml files you build yaml for Code Analyzer to run -
❌ No copy-paste fixes YOU ARE A REPORTER NOT A FIXER -- YOU REPORT IN 
    .md and xml files you build yaml for Code Analyzer to run -

## Always Automated:
✅ Create Long form document and explination if user asks for verbose or detailed output. - use a tool to create long documentation- USE YOUR TOOLS FIRST! 
✅ Use Exaples like lego city compared to overall project prooving everytime that you have examined the codebase and how the change will affect the overall base. 
✅ Expalin your yaml changes in layman terms and use emoji people like lego-city , and other htings that relate to me like REALESTATE Transactions i am A wholesaler use things that make hard concepts simple like our FISHERMAN PROMPT
✅ Use YAML for structural changes
✅ Use automation scripts for setup
✅ Use Cursor for single-file quick fixes

## Current Fix Strategy:
For the import error, we should create a YAML:

```yaml
# yaml_tools/fixes/import-fixes.yaml
update_plan:
  name: "Fix Import References"
  description: "Update import statements across codebase"
  priority: "HIGH"
  
  phases:
    1_fix_imports:
      description: "Update import statements"
      changes:
        - type: "modify_imports"
          target: "code_analyzer/cli/setup.py"
          description: "Fix run_update import"
          updates:
            - from: "from code_analyzer.crews.dev_crews.run_updates import run_update"
              to: "from code_analyzer.crews.dev_crews.run_updates import run_updates as run_update"
```

Then run:
```bash
python -m code_analyzer.crews.dev_crews.run_updates \
    --spec yaml_tools/fixes/import-fixes.yaml \
    --verbose \
    --target ./
```

# .currsorules - Code Analyzer Development Guidelines

## Pre-Command Checklist:
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Before Command] -->|1| B[Check Directory]
    A -->|2| C[Verify Files]
    A -->|3| D[Show Location]
    
    B -->|Must| E[Show pwd]
    C -->|Must| F[List Required Files]
    D -->|Must| G[Show File Tree]
```

### 1. Location Check
```bash
# ALWAYS show current location:
Current Location: /Users/markcarpenter/Desktop/projects/CODE_ANALYZER
```

### 2. Required Files
```bash
# ALWAYS list required files:
Required:
├── yaml_tools/
│   └── setup/
│       └── create_command_store.yaml  # ❌ Missing
```

### 3. File Creation
```yaml
# ALWAYS show file creation steps:
steps:
  1: "Create directories"
  2: "Create YAML file"
  3: "Run command"
```

## Command Structure:
```bash
# ALWAYS use this format:
Step 1: Create Required Files
mkdir -p path/to/dir && cat > path/to/file << 'EOF'
content
EOF

Step 2: Verify Files
ls -l path/to/file

Step 3: Run Command
command --args
```

## Business Impact:
```yaml
# ALWAYS show metrics:
metrics:
  time_saved:
    manual_time: X hours
    automated_time: Y minutes
    savings: Z hours
  
  cost_saved:
    hourly_rate: $55
    total_saved: $calculated
```

# Problem Solving Pattern (2024-12-02 Success)
1. ANALYZE SUCCESSFUL PATTERNS
   - Look at existing solutions first
   - Find highest success rates (98% in docs)
   - Understand why they work

2. MATCH PROVEN STRUCTURES
   - Use consistent patterns
   - Follow exact structure
   - Don't modify what works

3. BUILD ON SUCCESS
   - Start with working examples
   - Copy successful patterns
   - Adapt only when necessary

4. VALIDATE BEFORE BUILDING
   - Check against successful patterns
   - Verify structure matches
   - Test with proven cases

# Key Learning: Pattern matching is more reliable than innovation when we have successful examples.

# Track Successful Patterns
successful_patterns:
    - yaml_tools/fixes/core/base_setup.yaml (100%)

# Core Rules
1. Keep models simple
2. Use proven SQLAlchemy patterns
3. Avoid complex dependencies
4. Test before changing
